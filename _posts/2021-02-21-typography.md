Just some thoughts here.

Nothing too crazy. As we're not traditionally bloggers in any sense we figured it would be nice just to
have one simply to keep users up to date on any improvements and changes. We'd also 
like to do things like this from time to time where we just talk about what's on our mind.

As major backend, systems, infrastructure type guys building this thing we've developed 
a fond appreciation for front end development. 

While we excel at all of the back end technologies, cloud and server connection we've finally
been launched into the world of designing user interfaces and we suck :D.

We'll just keep trying though. Unless there's a front-end developer out there that would
like to join the team. LOL :D yeah imagine that, but it would be nice.
