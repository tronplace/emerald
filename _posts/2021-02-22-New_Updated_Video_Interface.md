Hey, I hope all is well with yall out there.

Just wanted to say tha we're grateful and appreciate the 
early users of our platform. If you have any suggestions to improve the platform we'd like to
hear from you.

Our goal is to build a communications platform you can be confident in. Created by the people
and for the people - yada yada you know the shpiel. 

Anyway, oh yeah. As you may have noticed we've updated the video chat user interface and 
resolved some bugs.

It was fun. We added social media sharing buttons and user controls.

We made them sloppy in hopes that a front end developer would reach out to us
to help. Heehee hinthint

We've also resolved the frozen user upon refresh issue.

It has been reported that this will still happen from time to time when using
different devices to connect. I.E. Desktop, phone, tablet etc.

If all users are on PC's it doesn't seem to happen.
Also the same if all users are on Macs

Oh well, we'll keep working at it. :D

It's free and it's functional. Thats a start I guess.

Excited to see this plant grow into a tree.

Imagine what we can build when we imagine together.
