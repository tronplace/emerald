![Test](https://conference.tronplace.com/images/video-conference.jpg "Tronplace-Launch")
Where excited to launch, [TronPlace.com](https://tronplace.com). Tronplace was created based on our passion for privacy when communicating. 
We wanted to provide free private communication in a simple way over the web browser.

We don't claim to be the most secure yada yada. We just care about your privacy. The greed is at an all time high and your internet data is the oil. 

Everything is for sale. Even you in this world. We created Tronplace simply so people can enjoy their technology without all of that bullshit.

## Our Interest

We're interested in lots of things. We'll go over the obvious.
1. Cryptography
2. Encryption
3. Blockchain
4) Tron
5) Ethereum
6) Network communication protocols
7) We believe in freedom of speach but not freedom to be an asshole that gets off on fucking with people or making others feel like shit.
8) Fishing
9) Racecars
10) Cute girls
11) rollerblades (we're bringin em back)
12) basically just cool ass next level shit.


### What we look forward to:

It would be cool if we could just work together, vibe, listen to cool music, share things, build, explore.

We're open to suggestions to improve the platform.

> Anyway this is the launch of [TronPlace.com](https://tronplace.com) . Just a cool place to kick it for free without your activity being mined and evaluated.
